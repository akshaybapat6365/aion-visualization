This commit resolves all merge conflicts by ensuring Phase 2 files take precedence:

✅ index.html - Phase 2 modernized version with consolidated assets
✅ enhanced-chapter11.html - Resolved appropriately  
✅ Navigation system - Complete Phase 2 implementation preserved
✅ All assets - Organized in /assets/ structure for Phase 3

Phase 2 Features Confirmed:
- Unified navigation with dropdown menus
- Advanced routing system (28 routes)
- Progress tracking with localStorage
- Mobile-responsive design
- Comprehensive test suite
- Modern index.html with consolidated asset paths

Ready for merge and Phase 3 migration." || echo "Nothing to commit"
