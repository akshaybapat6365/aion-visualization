# Motion-to-Meaning Mapping (Editorial Review)

This document defines the canonical semantic mapping between visualization state transitions and motion grammar presets.

## Semantic presets

- **Opposition**: express contradiction and psychic tension through clear differentiation.
- **Integration**: express reconciliation and synthesis into a larger whole.
- **Transformation**: express staged, qualitative change across phases.
- **Cyclical return**: express recurrence with accumulated insight.

## Visualization transition mapping

| Visualization module | State transition | Semantic preset | Editorial interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `conceptGraph` | `overview -> polarized` | Opposition | Conceptual poles become explicit and distinguishable. |
| `conceptGraph` | `polarized -> synthesis` | Integration | Opposed concepts are held in a meaningful relation. |
| `conceptGraph` | `synthesis -> new-symbol` | Transformation | A new symbol emerges from prior synthesis. |
| `conceptGraph` | `new-symbol -> overview` | Cyclical return | Learner returns to whole-map context with updated understanding. |
| `shadowIntegration` | `denial -> confrontation` | Opposition | Avoided content is brought into tension with conscious stance. |
| `shadowIntegration` | `confrontation -> dialogue` | Integration | Inner conflict shifts from split to relational encounter. |
| `shadowIntegration` | `dialogue -> assimilation` | Transformation | New psychic structure is formed through phase change. |
| `shadowIntegration` | `assimilation -> reflection` | Cyclical return | Process loops back as reflective practice. |
| `alchemyLab` | `nigredo -> albedo` | Transformation | Initial breakdown yields altered symbolic organization. |
| `alchemyLab` | `albedo -> citrinitas` | Transformation | Clarification continues in a staged sequence. |
| `alchemyLab` | `citrinitas -> rubedo` | Integration | Distinct elements unify into fuller realization. |
| `alchemyLab` | `rubedo -> nigredo` | Cyclical return | Completion resets into a new cycle of work. |
| `chapterNavigation` | `current -> next` | Integration | Guided progression deepens and integrates prior chapter insight. |
| `chapterNavigation` | `current -> previous` | Opposition | Returning backward highlights productive tension/contrast. |
| `chapterNavigation` | `current -> distant` | Transformation | Non-linear jump signals a significant frame shift. |
| `chapterNavigation` | `final -> first` | Cyclical return | Whole narrative closes and reopens as recurrence. |

## Reduced-motion equivalence rule

For every semantic preset, reduced-motion mode must:

1. Keep the same semantic preset label.
2. Keep the same learning objective and conceptual meaning.
3. Replace interpolation-heavy animation with direct state cues (layout grouping, phase labels, badges, zoning, recurrence indicators).

This ensures accessibility compliance without semantic loss.
