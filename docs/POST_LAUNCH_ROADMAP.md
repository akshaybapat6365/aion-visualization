## Technical Architecture

### Performance Targets
```javascript
const PERFORMANCE_BUDGET = {
  javascript: 250,      // 250KB max
  css: 60,             // 60KB max
  images: 500,         // 500KB max
  fonts: 100,          // 100KB max
  total: 1000,         // 1MB max
  
  metrics: {
    fcp: 1000,         // 1s First Contentful Paint
    lcp: 2500,         // 2.5s Largest Contentful Paint
    tti: 3500,         // 3.5s Time to Interactive
    cls: 0.1,          // Cumulative Layout Shift
    fid: 100           // First Input Delay
  }
};
```

### Code Quality Standards
```javascript
// Every new feature must:
- Have 90%+ test coverage
- Pass accessibility audit
- Include performance tests
- Have documentation
- Support offline mode
- Work without JavaScript
- Be internationalizable
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Jest with 90% coverage
2. **Integration Tests**: Playwright for user flows
3. **Visual Tests**: Percy for regression
4. **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse CI
5. **Accessibility Tests**: axe-core automated
