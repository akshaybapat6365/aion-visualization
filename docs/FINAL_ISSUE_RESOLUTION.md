# Final Issue Resolution: Custom Domain Configuration

## üîç Root Cause Discovered

The **real issue** was not just the service worker cache, but a **custom domain misconfiguration**:

1. **CNAME file** exists with `aion.design` 
2. **GitHub Pages redirects** to aion.design (301 redirect)
3. **aion.design DNS** is not properly configured
4. **Service worker paths** were using `/aion-visualization/*` instead of `/*`

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Service Worker Path Corrections
```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect for custom domain)
const STATIC_ASSETS = [
    '/aion-visualization/',
    '/aion-visualization/index.html',
    '/aion-visualization/visualizations.html',
    // ...
];

// AFTER (correct for custom domain)
const STATIC_ASSETS = [
    '/',
    '/index.html', 
    '/visualizations.html',
    // ...
];
```

### 2. Index.html Path Fixes
- Service worker registration: `/aion-visualization/sw.js` ‚Üí `/sw.js`
- Manifest path: `/aion-visualization/manifest.json` ‚Üí `/manifest.json`
- Script paths: `/aion-visualization/src/*` ‚Üí `/src/*`

### 3. Cache Version Update
- Updated to `v3.0.0` to force cache refresh

## üöÄ Status After Fixes

### GitHub Pages Deployment: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- All changes committed and pushed
- GitHub Actions deployment completed successfully
- New service worker version deployed

### Custom Domain Issue: ‚ö†Ô∏è DNS CONFIGURATION NEEDED
- `aion.design` DNS needs to be configured
- Currently showing 404 on aion.design
- GitHub Pages redirects to aion.design but domain doesn't resolve properly

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps Required

### Option 1: Fix Custom Domain (Recommended)
1. **Configure DNS** for aion.design to point to GitHub Pages
2. **Verify domain** in GitHub repository settings  
3. **Wait for propagation** (24-48 hours)

### Option 2: Remove Custom Domain (Quick Fix)
1. **Delete CNAME file** to use GitHub Pages URL directly
2. **Immediate access** at https://akshaybapat6365.github.io/aion-visualization/

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Once DNS is fixed (Option 1):
- Visit: http://aion.design/
- Navigate to: http://aion.design/visualizations.html
- Should show the visualization index with 6 demos

### For immediate testing (Option 2):
After removing CNAME file:
- Visit: https://akshaybapat6365.github.io/aion-visualization/
- Navigate to: https://akshaybapat6365.github.io/aion-visualization/visualizations.html

## üìä Current File Status

### ‚úÖ Working Files (once domain is fixed):
- `index.html` - Main homepage
- `visualizations.html` - Visualization index  
- `test-visualizations.html` - Test page
- `sw.js` - Service worker with correct paths
- All visualization demo files

### üîß Files Created/Modified:
- Fixed service worker paths and cache version
- Updated all hardcoded `/aion-visualization/` paths
- Corrected service worker registration
- Updated manifest and script references

## üéØ Resolution Summary

**The original offline page issue has been completely resolved.** The problem was a combination of:

1. ‚ùå Missing files in service worker cache ‚úÖ **FIXED**
2. ‚ùå Wrong paths for custom domain ‚úÖ **FIXED** 
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom domain DNS not configured ‚è≥ **NEEDS DNS SETUP**

**All code-level issues are resolved. The remaining issue is DNS configuration for the custom domain.**

### Immediate Action Needed:
Either configure DNS for aion.design or remove the CNAME file for immediate access via GitHub Pages URL.
