Phase 1: Asset Consolidation and Cleanup

## Summary
Complete reorganization of project structure with consolidated assets and improved maintainability.

## Changes Made
- **Directory Structure**: Created organized folder hierarchy (assets/, chapters/, tests/, scripts/)
- **CSS Consolidation**: Merged styles into main.css and chapters.css with design tokens
- **JavaScript Modules**: Consolidated into core utilities, navigation, and WebGL management
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced WebGL context management with memory monitoring  
- **Design System**: Museum-quality typography, spacing, and color system
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced focus states, reduced motion support, and ARIA compliance
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design throughout all components

## New File Structure
```
assets/
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.css (consolidated design system)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chapters.css (chapter-specific styles)
