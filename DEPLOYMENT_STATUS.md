# GitHub Pages Deployment Status

**Last Updated:** June 15, 2025 20:05 UTC

## 🚨 Current Issue

GitHub Pages is showing 404 errors for all pages except the homepage. This appears to be a deployment synchronization issue.

## 📊 Deployment Test Results

| Page | Local Status | GitHub Pages Status | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Homepage | ✅ Exists | ✅ Working | https://akshaybapat6365.github.io/aion-visualization/ |
| Visualizations | ✅ Exists | ❌ 404 | /visualizations.html |
| Chapters Index | ✅ Exists | ❌ 404 | /chapters/index.html |
| Chapter 2 | ✅ Exists | ❌ 404 | /chapters/enhanced/chapter-2.html |
| Shadow Demo | ✅ Exists | ❌ 404 | /src/visualizations/shadow/shadow-demo.html |
| Fish Timeline | ✅ Exists | ❌ 404 | /src/visualizations/chapters/chapter-4-fish/fish-timeline-showcase.html |

## 🔍 Diagnosis

1. **All files exist locally** and are properly tracked in git
2. **Last push was successful** (commit 535f90f)
3. **Only homepage is accessible** via GitHub Pages
4. **No Jekyll config** that might interfere
5. **Repository structure is correct**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Steps Taken

1. ✅ Verified all files exist locally
2. ✅ Confirmed files are tracked in git
3. ✅ Checked case sensitivity (all correct)
4. ✅ Updated README to trigger new deployment
5. ⏳ Waiting for GitHub Pages to sync

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Wait 10-20 minutes** for GitHub Pages to fully deploy
2. **Check GitHub Actions** for any deployment errors:
   - https://github.com/akshaybapat6365/aion-visualization/actions
3. **If still broken**, try:
   - Create `.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll processing
   - Check repository Settings → Pages for any errors
   - Force push to trigger rebuild

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

Once GitHub Pages syncs properly, all the following should work:
- ✅ All visualization demos
- ✅ All chapter pages
- ✅ Navigation throughout site
- ✅ Interactive features

## 📝 Notes

- This is likely a **temporary deployment delay**, not a code issue
- All fixes from Phase 1 & 2 are correct and committed
- The repository structure is clean and organized
- Files are properly referenced with correct paths

**Action Required:** Wait for deployment, then retest all URLs
