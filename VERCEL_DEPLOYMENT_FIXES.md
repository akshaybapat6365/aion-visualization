# Vercel Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Visualizations Not Loading (Gray Boxes)
**Problem**: The iframe sources in chapter HTML files were pointing to `.html` files (e.g., `/src/visualizations/shadow/shadow-demo.html`), but Vercel's `cleanUrls: true` setting was removing the `.html` extension, causing 308 redirects that broke iframe loading.

**Fix**: Removed `.html` extensions from all iframe `src` attributes in chapter files to match Vercel's clean URL structure.

**Files Fixed**:
- chapter-2.html (shadow visualization)
- chapter-3.html (constellation visualization)
- chapter-4.html (fish timeline)
- chapter-10.html (alchemy visualization)
- chapter-13.html (cosmology visualization)
- chapter-14.html (aion clock)

### 2. Navigation Sidebar Not Appearing
**Problem**: The `full-width.css` stylesheet was setting `padding: 0 !important` on `.main-content`, which was interfering with the navigation sidebar's layout. Additionally, the CSS for the main content wrapper needed to be explicitly defined in chapter pages.

**Fix**: Added CSS overrides to all chapter files to ensure:
- Body margin is reset
- Main content wrapper has proper left margin (250px) for the sidebar
- Responsive behavior works correctly on mobile
- Transitions are smooth when toggling the sidebar

**Files Fixed**: All 14 chapter HTML files in `/chapters/` directory

## Implementation Details

The fixes were applied using an automated script that:
1. Searched for iframe sources with `.html` extensions pointing to visualization demos
2. Removed the `.html` extension to match Vercel's clean URL routing
3. Added CSS overrides to ensure navigation sidebar displays correctly
4. Preserved all existing styling and functionality

## Testing Recommendations

After deployment, verify:
1. All visualizations load properly in their iframes
2. Navigation sidebar appears on all chapter pages
3. Sidebar toggle button works correctly
4. Mobile responsive behavior functions as expected
5. No JavaScript console errors related to navigation or visualizations

## Vercel Configuration Note

The current `vercel.json` configuration with `cleanUrls: true` is maintained. This setting provides cleaner URLs but requires all internal references to omit the `.html` extension.
