## Technical Innovations

### 1. Advanced Three.js Features
```javascript
// 3D Astrological Clock with Precession
const zodiacWheel = new THREE.Group();
const precessionAngle = -(year / 25920) * 2 * Math.PI;
zodiacWheel.rotation.z = precessionAngle;

// Dynamic constellation generation
zodiacSigns.forEach((sign, index) => {
  const sprite = new THREE.Sprite(spriteMaterial);
  const angle = (index * 30 - 90) * Math.PI / 180;
  sprite.position.set(
    Math.cos(angle) * radius,
    Math.sin(angle) * radius,
    0.1
  );
});
```

### 2. Interactive D3.js Visualizations
```javascript
// Emanation level progression
function updateEmanation(phase) {
  spheres.forEach((sphere, index) => {
    if (index <= phase) {
      sphere.visible = true;
      const scale = 1 + Math.sin(Date.now() * 0.002 + index) * 0.1;
      sphere.scale.set(scale, scale, scale);
    }
  });
}
```

### 3. Drag-and-Drop Alchemy
```javascript
// Ingredient mixing system
vessel.addEventListener('drop', (e) => {
  const element = e.dataTransfer.getData('text/plain');
