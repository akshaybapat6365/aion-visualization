## What Was Accomplished in Phase 1

### âœ… New Directory Structure
```
aion-visualization/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.css (consolidated design system)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chapters.css (chapter-specific styles)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ js/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ navigation.js (unified navigation)

â”‚           â””â”€â”€ webgl-manager.js (WebGL optimization)
â”œâ”€â”€ chapters/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ standard/ (for original chapters)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ enhanced/ (for enhanced chapters)
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/ (testing infrastructure)
â””â”€â”€ scripts/ (build and deployment scripts)
```

### âœ… Key Improvements
- **Museum-quality design system** with consistent typography and spacing
- **Advanced WebGL management** with memory optimization and context pooling
- **Unified navigation system** with theme support and mobile responsiveness
- **Comprehensive utilities** for animations, error handling, and common functions
- **Accessibility enhancements** with proper focus states and reduced motion support
- **Performance optimizations** with device detection and adaptive rendering

This establishes a solid foundation for the remaining phases of the website fix and improvement plan.
