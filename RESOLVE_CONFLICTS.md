# Resolving Merge Conflicts for Phase 2 PR #55

## Current Situation
- ‚úÖ Pull request #55 created successfully
- ‚ùå Merge conflicts detected in `index.html`
- üîç Conflicts need to be resolved before merge

## Quick Resolution Steps

### Option 1: Command Line Resolution (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/akshaybapat/aion-visualization

# Switch to the Phase 2 branch
git checkout phase2-navigation-system-fix

# Fetch latest changes from main
git fetch origin main

# Merge main into your branch to resolve conflicts
git merge origin/main

# This will show conflicts in index.html
# Git will mark conflict areas with <<<<<<< and >>>>>>>
```

### Option 2: Use GitHub's Web Interface

1. Go to the PR: https://github.com/yourusername/aion-visualization/pull/55
2. Click "Resolve conflicts" button
3. GitHub will show you the conflicting sections
4. Choose which version to keep or manually edit

### Option 3: Reset and Recreate (If conflicts are complex)

```bash
cd /Users/akshaybapat/aion-visualization

# Get the latest main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create a fresh branch from latest main
git checkout -b phase2-navigation-fix-v2

# Copy our Phase 2 files over the latest main
# This ensures we have the latest main as base
```

## Understanding the Conflict

The conflict is likely in `index.html` because:
- We completely rewrote `index.html` in Phase 2
- There may have been other changes to `index.html` on main branch
- Git can't automatically merge these different versions

## Recommended Resolution Strategy

### Step 1: Check what's in conflict
```bash
git checkout phase2-navigation-system-fix
git merge origin/main
# This will show you exactly what's conflicting
```

### Step 2: Resolve the index.html conflict
The conflict markers will look like this:
```html
<<<<<<< HEAD
<!-- Your Phase 2 version -->
<html>
  <!-- Phase 2 modern version with consolidated assets -->
=======
<!-- Main branch version -->
<html>
  <!-- Original version -->
>>>>>>> origin/main
```

### Step 3: Choose the resolution
**Recommended**: Keep the Phase 2 version since it's a complete modernization:
- Remove the conflict markers
- Keep the Phase 2 version of index.html
- It has consolidated assets and modern design

### Step 4: Complete the merge
```bash
# After resolving conflicts in your editor
git add index.html
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts - keep Phase 2 index.html version"
git push origin phase2-navigation-system-fix
```
