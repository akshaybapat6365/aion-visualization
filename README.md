## Visualizations

This project includes six interactive visualizations:

1. **Ego Visualization** - Orbiting persona labels around a glowing ego centre with interactive drag dynamics.
2. **Historical Timeline** - Tracing the Christ-pole and Antichrist-shadow dynamics across 2000+ years of history, following the zodiacal "hour-hand."
3. **Archetype Dynamics** - Mathematical projections showing the shifting intensities of key archetypes (Shadow, Self, Anima/Animus, Trickster) from 1900-2300.
4. **Archetype Profiles** - Radar chart comparison of archetypal configurations, contrasting patterns between 2025 and 2200 to reveal epochal shifts.
5. **Self-Integration Curve** - The trajectory from projection to integration of the Self archetype through historical milestones, moving toward Jung's "coniunctio."
6. **Archetype Network** - Force-directed graph exploring relationships between Self, Shadow, Anima/Animus and Trickster.
