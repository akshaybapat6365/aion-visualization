# Contributing to Aion Visualization

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project is a collection of static HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that power interactive visualizations of Jungian concepts.

## Environment Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akshaybapat6365/aion-visualization.git
   cd aion-visualization
   ```
2. **Install a simple web server** (optional). You can preview the site by opening `src/index.html` directly in your browser, but running a local server more closely matches the GitHub Pages environment. Examples:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   cd src
   python3 -m http.server
   # or using Node
   npx http-server
   ```
   Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Previewing the Visualizations

All HTML files live in the `src/` directory. Open `index.html` to view the main navigation and explore the available chapters and demos. Any changes you make can be previewed instantly by refreshing your browser while your local server is running.

## Submitting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on GitHub. Provide as much detail as possible including steps to reproduce the problem or screenshots of the desired feature.

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Make your changes following the existing file organization and coding style.
3. Commit your work with clear messages and push to your fork.
4. Open a pull request against the `main` branch with a description of your changes.

We appreciate all contributions that help improve the project!
