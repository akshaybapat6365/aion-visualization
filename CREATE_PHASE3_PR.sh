🎯 PHASE 3 ENHANCED CHAPTER MIGRATION
Organized chapter structure and prepared migration scripts

## Enhanced Chapter Organization
✅ Created move-enhanced-chapters.sh script for systematic migration
✅ Prepared chapters/enhanced/ directory structure
✅ Built comprehensive migration commands and documentation
✅ Ready to migrate all 14 chapters from src/ to organized structure

## Migration Features
✅ Consistent chapter naming: chapter-1.html, chapter-2.html, etc.
✅ Automated asset path updates for new directory structure
✅ CSS path updates: ../../assets/css/main.css
✅ JS path updates: ../../assets/js/core/navigation.js
✅ Chapter link updates for new naming convention

## Phase 3 Documentation
✅ PHASE3_MORNING_COMMANDS.md with execution instructions
✅ Comprehensive migration script with error handling
✅ Manual alternative commands for backup execution
✅ Asset path update automation for seamless transition

## File Structure Preparation
\`\`\`
chapters/
├── enhanced/           # Target for enhanced chapters 1-14
│   ├── chapter-1.html  # Consistent naming convention
│   ├── chapter-2.html
│   └── ... (all 14 chapters)
└── standard/           # Reserved for future standard versions
\`\`\`

## Migration Process
1. Move src/chapter*.html → chapters/enhanced/chapter-*.html
2. Update all asset references to new paths
3. Update internal chapter links to new naming
4. Remove old chapter files from src/
5. Update navigation system for new structure

## Ready for Execution
This commit provides all tools needed to execute the enhanced chapter migration.
Next step: Run ./move-enhanced-chapters.sh to complete the migration.

## Technical Details
- Automated sed commands for path updates
- Comprehensive error checking and logging
- Preserves all Phase 3 enhancements in chapter files
- Compatible with existing Phase 2 navigation system
