   - Reuse visualization components
   - Maintain consistent UI/UX

3. **Quality Assurance Protocol**
   - Test each chapter immediately
   - Verify Phase 3 integration
   - Ensure educational accuracy

### Risk Mitigation
- **Time**: 50-60 hours needed, plan for 10-12 days
- **Complexity**: Use existing patterns from completed chapters
- **Quality**: Maintain Phase 3 standards throughout
- **Testing**: Continuous validation prevents late issues
